# Chapter 1: Giving and Receiving – Inputs and Outputs

## Step 3: Reports and Notices

### Reports for Logging and Error Handling

So far, you have learned how to:

* Read inputs sent to your application
* Decode payloads
* Create verifiable outputs using **notices**

Cartesi Rollups provides another important message mechanism called **reports**.
Reports are logs produced by the application and are primarily used for **debugging, logging, and error reporting**. Unlike notices, reports are not meant to represent application results, but rather to expose internal information about execution.

In this step, you will learn how to decide **which type of output to generate** based on the content of the input message.

### Objective

Decode the incoming payload and:

* Create a **report** if the message contains the text `"Grinch"`
* Otherwise, create a **notice**

### User Instructions

* **Code Editing Guidelines**: Only modify the sections explicitly marked for changes. Keep everything else intact.
* **Task**: Add conditional logic to choose between creating a report or a notice.

### Required Modification

Inside `handle_advance`, you will:

1. Read and decode the payload
2. Check the decoded message content
3. Use `/report` for logging when needed - The report payload should be the **encoded** string: "Nice try, Grinch!"
4. Use `/notice` for normal application output - The notice payload should be the **encoded** string: "Time to exchange gifts!"

Reports and notices are both created by sending a `POST` request to the rollup node, but to different endpoints.

### Input Examples

**Input containing `"Grinch"`**

```js
"I am the Grinch"
```

This will generate a **report**, useful for logging or signaling an error condition.

**Any other input**

```js
"Happy Holidays"
```

This will generate a **notice**, representing a normal application output.
