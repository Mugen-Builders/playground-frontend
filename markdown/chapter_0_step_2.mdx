# Step 3: Listing Missions

This is great! Now we know how to read data, manipulate it, and return it. We are already able to send inputs to our dApp through the *'handle_advance'* function. But what about the *'handle_inspect'*?

## Inspect
Just as we specialized the advance calls, we're going to do the same for inspect calls.

Picture an adventurer who wants to check the missions available at a tavern in a big city. It doesn't make sense for the user to send an input and get that input returned just to list missions. Anyone should be able to check the available missions, right?

For this, we can use an inspect callâ€”an HTTP request directly to the node to check its current state!

It's as easy as checking a URL in your browser, like this:

## Input
```url
https://jplayground.fly.dev/inspect/list_missions
```

But there's more! Here, we are finally going to understand another type of output: the **report**.

## Reports

Reports are stateless logs, offering a means to record read-only information without changing the state. Primarily used for logging and diagnostic purposes, reports provide valuable insights into the operation and performance of a dApp.

Unlike notices, reports lack any association with proof and are therefore unsuitable for facilitating trustless interactions, such as on-chain processing or convincing independent third parties of dApp outcomes.

Reports can be used both in the advance function to create logs, generally used for handling errors, or inside the inspect function to signal the output.

## Objective

Your task in this chapter is to modify the *'list_missions'* function, which is called inside the `handle_inspect` function, to return a list of missions.

Remember what we've seen before: The `handle_inspect` is similar to a `GET` request in that it does not alter the state of the machine; it only allows you to check the current state.

The idea is that this exercise will give you the ability to read data without requiring interactions.

The second objective here is to understand what a **report** is. Check the code and see how it is used as an output for that single call.

The `handle_inspect` function has already been modified to decode the payload and use it to route to a `listMissions` function.

## User Instructions
- **Code Editing Guidelines**: Focus your modifications on the `handle_inspect` function. Maintain the rest of the application's structure to ensure it continues to operate correctly.

Suggested **Tasks**:
- Review the modifications in the `handle_inspect` function to check for specific requests and call the corresponding function.
- Note that the implementation of `handle_inspect` uses `fetch` to create an output called a **report**. This is another type of output generated by the Cartesi rollups framework.
  - When used inside a handle_inspect, it is the default way of setting the output that the user gets when invoking the HTTP request.
- Edit the `listMissions` function to return the list of available missions.

## Required Modification
Here is how you should modify the `listMissions` function to incorporate a new route that provides a list of missions:

Return a JSON object with the structure `{ missions }`.

But remember! It has to be stringified and then converted to hex!

### Side Note
Of course, in a final version of this dApp, we would verify the missions by user, so it would be something like this:
```url
https://jplayground.fly.dev/inspect/list_missions/<wallet_id>
```
To test it you can just swap the tag for the wallet you are using and see the magic happen!

Remember the payload will come in a hex format, so use an online too to convert it and read! like (this one)[https://codebeautify.org/hex-string-converter]

But for now, there's no need to worry about that!
