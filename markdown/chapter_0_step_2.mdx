# Chapter 3: Managing the Mission List

In Cartesia, a hero's duty is to take on quests that shape the destiny of the land. Now that your presence is known, it's time to access your first set of missions. This chapter will teach you how to create a dynamic response in your dApp, allowing you to serve a list of available quests. You will modify the `handle_inspect` function to introduce this new functionality.

## Chapter Overview: Deploying the Quests

Your task in this chapter is to modify the `handle_inspect` function to return a list of missions. The `handle_inspect` is similar to a `GET` request in the sense that it does not alter the state of the machine, it only allows you to check the current state. 

## Objective
The objective here is to program your dApp to return a specific list of missions upon request. This will give you the ability to manage and manipulate data based on user interactions and predefined conditions.
The second objective here is to understand what is a **report**
The `handle_inspect` function was already modified to decode the payload and use it to route to a `listMissions` function

## User Instructions
- **Code Editing Guidelines**: Focus your modifications on the `handle_inspect` function. Maintain the rest of the application's structure to ensure it continues to operate correctly.
- **Task**: Read the modifications of the `handle_inspect` function to check for a specific request and call the corresponding function.
- **Task**: See that in the implementation for `handle_inspect` uses the `fetch` to create an output called **report**. This is another type of output generated by the Cartesi rollups framework.
When used inside a handle_inspect it is the default way of setting the output that the user gets when invoking the http request.
- **Task**: Edit the `listMissions` function to return the list of available missions


## Required Modification
Here is how you should modify the `listMissions` function to incorporate a new route that provides a list of missions:

```javascript
function listMissions() {
  return str2hex(jsonToStr({ missions }))
}
```

## Input
To get the mission list and inspect the state one only have to perform a get request:
```url
http://<rollup_server>/listMissions"
```

By successfully completing this chapter, you will expand your understanding of how to handle different types of data and requests in a decentralized application. You'll learn to dynamically serve content based on user requests, preparing you for more complex interactions in the future adventures of Cartesia.
