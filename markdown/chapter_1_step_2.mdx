# Step 8: All at Once! Killing the Dragon and Checking Notices

Now you know how to perform actions by sending inputs, and you also know how to query the outputs of the actions you trigger. Let's emulate how you would do that.

## Chapter Overview: Striking the Dragon

Your task in this chapter is to modify the `attackDragon` function, which is called inside `handle_advance`, to change the dragon's status from alive to dead once you attack it. After that, check the notice that was created to see the dragon's health status, and then keep attacking until you receive the message, "User: your dragon is dead."

## Required Modification
Here is how you should modify the `attackDragon` function to incorporate a new route that handles the dragon's health:

```javascript
function attackDragon() {
  dragonHP -= 20;
  if (dragonHP === 0) {
    return str2hex(`Your dragon is dead`);
  }
  return str2hex(jsonToStr({ health: dragonHP }));
}
```

## Input
To attack the dragon, send this data in your transaction:
```json
{
  "route": "attack_dragon"
}
```

After sending this, you will receive an input ID, which you can use to check the notice generated for it afterward in the **GraphQL Playground** or the **Cartesi Explorer**:

**Remember to get its ID from the log after clicking run.**
Only advance to the next step after killing the dragon!

By successfully completing this chapter, you will understand how to retrieve the outputs for the functions you just called!
