# Step 7: Queries on Your Outputs

As seen in the last chapter, to query the state of a Cartesi Rollups instance, you can list notices and reports. But more than that, you can search for specific outputs from the input you sent.

Once you know your input index, which will be the **return from the transaction you signed**, you can use that index to query for specific notices and vouchers generated by that transaction.

## Objective

Once again, the goal of this session is not to implement code but to view what you have produced so far.

On the side, a GraphQL query is provided to retrieve notices and another to retrieve reports from a specific index.

## User Instructions

- **Access the GraphQL Playground**: Open a new window and navigate to the URL `http://localhost:8080/graphql`.
- **Query notices and reports**: Paste the content of these variables into the playground to perform the queries and see a list of notices and reports generated by you and other heroes.
- **Change the index in the query**:
    In the bottom-left corner of the explorer interface, you'll find a section that provides variables. Click on it to expand it, and then you can input your variables like this:
    ```json
    {
      "inputIndex": 1
    }
    ```
