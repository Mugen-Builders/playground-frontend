## Introduction

In the previous step, you introduced application state by incrementing a counter on every advance request.
In this step, you will learn how to **read that state** without sending a transaction.

# Chapter 2: Counting – Updating State

## Step 2: Reading State with Inspect

### Inspect Requests

Cartesi Rollups provides **inspect requests** so you can query the application without changing state.
If `handle_advance` is used for state transitions, `handle_inspect` is used for **read-only queries**.

For inspect requests, the common practice is to return information through **reports**, since inspect is generally used for debugging, visibility, and state inspection.

### Objective

When an inspect request is received, return the current value of `gifts` using a **report**.

### User Instructions

* **Code Editing Guidelines**: Only modify the sections explicitly marked for changes. Keep everything else intact.
* **Task**: Create a report in `handle_inspect` that contains the current `gifts` value.

### Required Modification

Inside `handle_inspect`, send a `POST` request to the `/report` endpoint.
The payload must be hex-encoded, so convert the value using `str2hex`.

### Code Snippet

Add the following code under **“Your code logic goes here”**:

```js
await fetch(rollup_server + "/report", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    // Message content 
  }),
});
```

## Sign the transaction
To claim your prize sign the transaction at the end of this chapter to prove you completed it! 

- First connect you wallet (on the top right of this page)
- You will need SepoliaETH.
  - You can get some at a faucet like this one: https://www.alchemy.com/faucets/ethereum-sepolia
