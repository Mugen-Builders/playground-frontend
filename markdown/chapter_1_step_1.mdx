# Chapter 7: Queries on your outputs

As seen on last chapter to query the state of a Cartesi Rollups instance you can list notices and reports, but more than that, you can search for specific outputs from the input you sent.

Once knowing your input index, which will be the **return from the transaction you signed** you can use that index to query for specific notices and vouchers generated by that transaction.

## Objective

Once again, on this session the idea is not to implement code, but to view what you have produced so far.

On the side it is presented a graphql query to retrieve notices and one to retrieve reports from a specific index. 

## User Instructions

- **Access the explorer**: On another windows access the url http://localhost:8080/graphql
- **Query notices and reports**: Paste the content of these variables there to perform the queries and see a list of notices and reports generated by your and other heroes
- **Change the index in the query**:
    In the bottom-left corner of the explorer interface, you'll find a section that provides variables. Click on it to expand it, and then you can input your variables like this:
```
{
  "inputIndex": 1
}
```
