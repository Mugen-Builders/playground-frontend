# Chapter 2: Set Forth on Your Quest

# Step 6: Listing Outputs

In the last module, you learned how to handle inputs sent to the Cartesi dApp, check the state with inspect calls, alter the state based on inputs within advance calls, and even handle errors.

But there’s something we haven’t covered yet—how to retrieve the outputs from the calls that were sent. Using inspect repeatedly is not recommended. The less you use it, the better! The best practice is to check the outputs generated through the GraphQL API whenever possible.

One of the ways to check these outputs is through the GraphQL Playground. Another way is through the Cartesi Explorer.

- **Access the GraphQL Playground**: Open a new window and navigate to the URL `https://jplayground.fly.dev/graphql`.
    - Here, you can paste the provided commands, which will return a list of notices and vouchers.
- **Access the Cartesi Explorer**: Open another window and navigate to the URL `https://sepolia.cartesiscan.io/`.
    - Here, you can see the transactions that were made to Cartesi dApps deployed on various networks and view the outputs generated for each input.
    - Link for direct access to this dApp is: https://sepolia.cartesiscan.io/applications/0x9aac56acda6168d33ffa321c2da43b505e4fff32
    
Of course, the best way to handle this information within your frontend is to use a GraphQL library or package and run the queries from there!

The GraphQL API is exposed by the Cartesi Nodes hosting your dApp, so for it to work, you need to pass the dApp address and GraphQL endpoint from the node.

The ones for this dApp are as follows:
- dApp Address: 0x9aac56acda6168d33ffa321c2da43b505e4fff32
- GraphQL Endpoint: https://jplayground.fly.dev/graphql

## GraphQL API
 
This API allows any client to retrieve outputs produced by a dApp's backend and link those outputs to the corresponding inputs that triggered them. Outputs can generally come in the form of vouchers, notices, and reports, and allow clients to both receive dApp updates and enforce consequences on the base layer.

The Cartesi Rollups state query API is fully specified by its GraphQL schema.

## Objective

In this session, the goal is not to implement code but to view what you have produced so far.

On the side, a GraphQL query is provided to retrieve notices and another to retrieve reports as a list.

## User Instructions

- **Query notices and reports**: Paste the content of these variables into the GraphQL Playground or look them up in the explorer to perform the queries and see a list of notices and reports generated by you and other adventurers.
