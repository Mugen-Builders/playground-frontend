# Chapter 6: Listing outputs

To query the state of a Cartesi Rollups instance, frontend clients can make use of a GraphQL API that is exposed by the Cartesi Nodes.

This API allows any client to retrieve outputs produced by a dApp's backend, and to link those outputs to the corresponding inputs that triggered them. Outputs can generally come in the form of vouchers, notices and reports, and allow clients to both receive dApp updates and enforce consequences on the base layer.

The Cartesi Rollups state query API is fully specified by its GraphQL schema.

This specification is displayed in a more accessible and navigable way in the next sections.

## Objective

On this session the idea is not to implement code, but to view what you have produced so far.

On the side it is presented a graphql query to retrive notices and one to retrieve reports as a list. 

## User Instructions

- **Access the explorer**: On another windows access the url http://localhost:8080/graphql
- **Query notices and reports**: Paste the content of these variables there to perform the queries and see a list of notices and reports generated by your and other heros
