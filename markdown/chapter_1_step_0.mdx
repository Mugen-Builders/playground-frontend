# Chapter 6: Listing outputs

In the last module you went through steps to learn how to treat inputs that are sent to the Cartesi dApp, Check the state with inspect calls, alter the state given inputs inside Advance calls and even treat errors.

But there is something that wasn't talked about, and this is how to get the outputs from the calls that were sent. Using inspect repeatedly is not recommended. The least you use it, the better! The best practice is that whenever possible you check through the graphQL API the outputs generated.

One of the ways of checking these outputs is through the graphQL Playground. The other one is in the Cartesi Explorer.

- **Access the GraphQL Playground**: On another window access the url http://localhost:8080/graphql
    - In here you can paste the commands presented to you on the side which will return a list of notices and vouchers
- **Access the Cartesi Explorer**: On another windows access the url http://localhost:8080/explorer
    - In here you can see the transactions that were made to Cartesi dApps deployed on a few networks, here you can see outputs generated for each input

Of course, the best way to deal with this information inside your frontend is to use a GraphQL lib or package and run the queries from there!


The GraphQL API is exposed by the Cartesi Nodes hosting your dApp, so the endpoint so for it to work you need to pass the dApp address and GraphQL endpoint from the node.

The ones for this dApp are as follows:
- dApp Address: 
- GraphQL Endpoint: 


## GraphQL API
 
This API allows any client to retrieve outputs produced by a dApp's backend, and to link those outputs to the corresponding inputs that triggered them. Outputs can generally come in the form of vouchers, notices and reports, and allow clients to both receive dApp updates and enforce consequences on the base layer.

The Cartesi Rollups state query API is fully specified by its GraphQL schema.

## Objective

On this session the idea is not to implement code, but to view what you have produced so far.

On the side it is presented a graphql query to retrieve notices and one to retrieve reports as a list. 

## User Instructions

- **Query notices and reports**: Paste the content of these variables in the GraphQL playground or look them up in the explorer to perform the queries and see a list of notices and reports generated by your and other adventurers.
