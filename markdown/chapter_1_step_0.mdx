## Introduction

In the previous chapter, you learned how to receive inputs and produce different kinds of outputs.
In this chapter, you will focus on **application state**—data that lives inside your Cartesi Rollups application and persists across multiple inputs.

# Chapter 2: Counting – Application State

## Step 1: Counting Inputs

### Application State

A Cartesi Rollups application is **stateful**. This means it can keep information in memory and update it every time a new input is processed.

In this step, you will work with a simple piece of state: a counter.
Each time the application receives an input, the counter will be incremented.

This demonstrates how state can evolve over time as users interact with your application.

### Objective

Update the application state by incrementing a counter every time an advance request is received.

### User Instructions

* **Code Editing Guidelines**: Only modify the sections explicitly marked for changes. Keep everything else intact.
* **Task**: Increment the `gifts` variable inside the `handle_advance` function.

### Provided State

The application already defines a state variable:

```js
let gifts = 0
```

This variable exists outside of `handle_advance`, which allows it to persist across multiple advance requests.

### Required Modification

Inside `handle_advance`, increment the `gifts` counter every time a new input arrives.

You can use `console.log` to follow the current value

### Result

Each advance request increases the value of `gifts` by one, showing how the application maintains and updates state across inputs.
