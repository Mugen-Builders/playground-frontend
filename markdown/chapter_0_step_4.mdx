# Chapter 5: Handling Errors and Reporting

Encountering errors is a very natural thing, such as choosing a quest that does not exist. It is one of many scenarios that need proper handling in your cartesi dApp. 

This chapter will guide you through creating reports to handle errors. 

## Objective

Your objective is to ensure that the dApp communicates effectively with users about errors or invalid actions. This involves sending detailed error reports when a mission cannot be accepted due to incorrect inputs or system failures.

## Concepts

Remember what you did see about reports so far:

Reports are stateless logs, offering a means to record read-only information without changing the state. Primarily used for logging and diagnostic purposes, reports provide valuable insights into the operation and performance of a dApp.

Unlike notices, reports lack any association with proof and are therefore unsuitable for facilitating trustless interactions, such as on-chain processing or convincing independent third parties of dApp outcomes.

## User Instructions

- **Code Editing Guidelines**: Modify only the `createReport` function.
- **Task**: Read the modified implementation of `handle_advance` to handle errors and return appropriate messages to the user.
- **Task**: Read the modified implementation of `acceptMission` to see how it returns null in case of error and how this is treated on the `handle_advance`

## Required Modification

The `acceptMission` function logic was modified here to return `null` in case the mission was not selectable.
If that happens, the handle advance will call the function `createReport`. Implement the function logic, it's similar to create notice, but the endpoint is changed.

## Input
The input of last chapter was the following:

```json
{
  "route": "accept_mission",
  "args": {
    "mission": "Kill the dragon"
  }
}
```

Now we want to actually create a report by provoking an error, so let's send a mission that is not in the list

```json
{
  "route": "accept_mission",
  "args": {
    "mission": "Fly on a pegasus"
  }
}
```

By implementing robust error handling and reporting, you not only prevent issues from escalating but also provide clear feedback to users, which is crucial for maintaining a positive user experience and trust in the application.
