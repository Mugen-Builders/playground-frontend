# Step 5: Handling Errors and Reporting

Encountering errors is a natural part of development, such as when a user chooses a quest that does not exist. Handling these scenarios properly is essential in your Cartesi dApp.

This chapter will guide you through creating reports to handle errors.

## Objective

Your objective is to ensure that the dApp communicates effectively with users about errors or invalid actions. This involves sending detailed error reports when a mission cannot be accepted due to incorrect inputs or system failures.

## Concepts

Remember what you’ve learned about reports so far:

Reports are stateless logs, offering a means to record read-only information without changing the state. Primarily used for logging and diagnostic purposes, reports provide valuable insights into the operation and performance of a dApp.

Unlike notices, reports lack any association with proof and are therefore unsuitable for facilitating trustless interactions, such as on-chain processing or convincing independent third parties of dApp outcomes.

## User Instructions

- **Code Editing Guidelines**: Modify only the `createReport` function.
- **Task**: Review the modified implementation of `handle_advance` to understand how it handles errors and returns appropriate messages to the user.
- **Task**: Examine the modified implementation of `acceptMission` to see how it returns null in case of an error and how this is handled in `handle_advance`.

## Required Modification

The `acceptMission` function logic has been modified to return `null` if the mission is not selectable. If that happens, `handle_advance` will call the `createReport` function. Implement the function logic; it’s similar to creating a notice, but the endpoint is different. Also, the response from the 'report' endpoint does not have a JSON body, so just return the response of the fetch function.

## Input
The input from the last chapter was the following:

```json
{
  "route": "accept_mission",
  "args": {
    "mission": "Kill the dragon"
  }
}
```

Now, to actually create a report by provoking an error, let’s send a mission that is not in the list:

```json
{
  "route": "accept_mission",
  "args": {
    "mission": "Fly on a pegasus"
  }
}
```

By implementing robust error handling and reporting, you not only prevent issues from escalating but also provide clear feedback to users, which is crucial for maintaining a positive user experience and trust in the application.
