# Chapter 5: Handling Errors and Reporting

Encountering errors during a quest selection, such as choosing a quest that does not exist, is one of many scenarios that need proper handling in your cartesi dApp. This chapter will guide you through creating reports to handle errors. By the end of this chapter, your dApp will be equipped to handle incorrect inputs and notify the user appropriately, improving user experience and application reliability.

## Objective

Your objective is to ensure that the dApp communicates effectively with users about errors or invalid actions. This involves sending detailed error reports when a mission cannot be accepted due to incorrect inputs or system failures.

## Concepts

Reports are stateless logs, offering a means to record read-only information without changing the state. Primarily used for logging and diagnostic purposes, reports provide valuable insights into the operation and performance of a dApp.

Unlike notices, reports lack any association with proof and are therefore unsuitable for facilitating trustless interactions, such as on-chain processing or convincing independent third parties of dApp outcomes.

## User Instructions

- **Code Editing Guidelines**: Modify only the `createReport` function.
- **Task**: Read the modified implementation of `handle_advance` to handle errors and return appropriate messages to the user.
- **Task**: Read the modified implementation of `acceptMission` to see how it returns null in case of error and how this is treated on the `handle_advance`

## Required Modification

The `acceptMission` function logic was modified here to return `null` in case the mission was not selectable.
If that happens, the handle advance will call the function `createReport`. Implement the function logic, it's similar to create notice, but the endpoint is changed.

## Input
The input of last chapter was the following:

```json
{
  "route": "acceptMission",
  "args": {
    "mission": "Kill the dragon"
  }
}
```

Now we want to actually create a report by provoking an error, so let's send a mission that is not in the list

```json
{
  "route": "acceptMission",
  "args": {
    "mission": "Fly on a pegasus"
  }
}
```

By implementing robust error handling and reporting, you not only prevent issues from escalating but also provide clear feedback to users, which is crucial for maintaining a positive user experience and trust in the application. This chapter sets the stage for creating a more resilient and user-friendly decentralized application.
