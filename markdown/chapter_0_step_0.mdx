## Introduction

Welcome to the **Mugen Builders Quests: Holiday Edition**, a tutorial platform designed to teach the core concepts of **Cartesi Rollups** while you build your first Cartesi Rollups application.

# Chapter 1: Giving and Receiving - Inputs and outputs

## Step 1: Messaging

### Echo Application

Let’s kick off your first user interaction in the Application. The provided code already includes two key function: **`handle_advance`** and **`handle_inspect`**.

For now we are going to use the **`handle_advance`** to perform **Advance Requests**:

* In a web2 mindset, they’re like **POST** method
* In a web3 mindset, they’re like **signed transactions**

Cartesi Rollups is able to produce three kinds of messages: 
- outupts called **notices** and **vouchers** 
- logs called **reports**.

In this chapter, we’ll start with the first one: the **notices**. A **notice** is a verifiable data declaration that attests to off-chain events or conditions and is accompanied by proof. It lets your execution layer “announce” important things in a way the base layer can trust.

To send an input, the user signs a transaction to a super important smart contract called the **Input Box** and it triggers the **`handle_advance`** inside your application.

### Objective

Modify the `handle_advance` function so it returns the same value as the input.

### User Instructions

* **Code Editing Guidelines**: Only modify the sections explicitly marked for changes. Keep everything else intact.
* **Task**: Add the notice creation snippet to test your code and hit run!

To create a notice, perform a `fetch` request to the rollup node’s `/notice` endpoint.

In the request body, send an object containing a `payload` property with the **same payload the contained in the incoming **data** object**.

That’s it: **what comes in goes out**, it's like santa is reading your card!

Pay attention to where `payload` comes from: it arrives in the `data` object inside `handle_advance`. Also, note the body must be a **stringified object** like `{ payload }`.

```javascript
await fetch(rollup_server + "/notice", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({ 
    // Message content 
  }),
}); 
```

### Input

The input sent to your function will be:

```js
"Happy Holidays, Everyone!"
```

And the output will be the same—echoed back as a festive notice.
