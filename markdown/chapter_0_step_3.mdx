# Chapter 4: Choosing Your Quest

As a hero in Cartesia, choosing a quest is an action that defines your path. Now that you've familiarized yourself with listing available quests, it's time to start by selecting a mission. This chapter guides you on how to modify the `handle_advance` function to include the accept a mission functionality, removing the selected one from the list of available quests.

## Chapter Overview: Selecting Your Destiny

Your task in this chapter is to extend the functionality of the `handle_advance` function. Unlike the `handle_inspect` function, which is passive, `handle_advance` can change the state of your dApp. You will create a sub-function that is called within it that handles the selection and removal of a quest from the available list based on user input.

## Objective

The objective is to enhance your dApp's functionality by allowing the hero (user) to pick a quest, which in turn updates the list of available missions. This dynamic change represents a core feature in decentralized applications where user actions can directly influence the app's state.

## User Instructions

- **Code Editing Guidelines**: Focus your modifications on the `acceptMission` function. Ensure any changes preserve the rest of the application's functionality.
- **Task**: Read `handle_advance` that handles the acceptance of a quest routes it to the correct function.
- **Task**: Ensure this function can update the mission list by removing the chosen mission.

## Required Modification

Modify the `acceptMission` function that processes the quest acceptance. Hereâ€™s how you can structure this:

```javascript
function acceptMission(args, missions) {
    // Logic to remove the selected mission

    return str2hex(jsonToStr({ 
        missionSelected: args.mission
    }));
}
```

## Input
The input to select a mission will be an object specifying the route and arguments for the mission to be accepted:

```json
{
  "route": "acceptMission",
  "args": {
    "mission": "Kill the dragon"
  }
}
```

By completing this chapter, you will advance your understanding of state changes in decentralized applications. You'll learn how user actions can dynamically alter the state, preparing you for building more interactive and responsive dApps in Cartesia.
