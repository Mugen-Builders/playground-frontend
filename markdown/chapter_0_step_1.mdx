# Step 2: Proclaiming Presence with Power

Great! If you're here, it probably means you completed the last chapter (or skipped it, which is not recommended since we covered some important concepts there). In the previous chapter, you learned how to get the input from the data object and return an element. Now, what if you want to see what's in the data element and return something else?

One of the simplest transformations or computations you can perform on a string is changing its capitalization, meaning converting the string to uppercase.

So, let's make the hero's voice resonate with strength and clarity. Let's take the input and change it to an UPPERCASE VERSION.

**Important: The inputs, just like the outputs, need to be in a hex format (0xA1b2C...). So encoding and decoding are crucial parts of this chapter.**

Your task in this chapter is to modify the code to not only send a message but to send it in a loud format.

## Objective
You will learn how to decode the received input, transform it to uppercase, and then return the newly encoded string.

This way, you will understand how to manipulate data within the Cartesi Rollups framework.

You will not modify the `createNotice` function, but instead, you will modify an auxiliary function, *toUpperFromPayload*, that will decode the incoming message, change it to uppercase, and return the encoded version of the modified message.

## User Instructions
- **Code Editing Guidelines**: Focus your modifications on the designated sections of the code. Do not alter the overall structure to maintain the operational integrity of the application.
- **Task**: Transform the input message to uppercase before sending it out as a notice.

## Required Modification
To effectively convert your input to uppercase, you will need to modify the `toUpperFromPayload` function as follows:

Use the auxiliary functions presented here (strToJson, jsonToStr, hex2str, str2hex) to:
- Decode the hex to a string.
- Convert the string to a JSON object.
- Edit the value of this JSON object using the toUpperCase() function.
- Convert this new object back to a string.
- Encode it to hex again.
- Return it.

## Input
The input will continue to be:
```json
{
  "message": "I'm here, Cartesia!"
}
```
But now, the output will be:
```json
{
  "message": "I'M HERE, CARTESIA!"
}
```
