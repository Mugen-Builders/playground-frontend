# Chapter 1: Giving and Receiving – Inputs and Outputs

## Step 2: Decoding the Message

### Decoding the Payload

In the previous step, you learned how to return an input as a notice.
Now, we will focus on understanding **what the application actually receives**.

When a user sends an input to a Cartesi Rollups application, the payload arrives **hex-encoded**. Before you can use it, you must decode it into a readable string.

The template already provides a helper function called `hex2str`, which converts a hex string into UTF-8 text. In this step, you will use it, or you can use `Buffer.from` just like the function do, to decode the incoming payload and print the result to the console.

### Objective

Decode the incoming `payload` and log the decoded message inside the `handle_advance` function.

### User Instructions

* **Code Editing Guidelines**: Only modify the sections explicitly marked for changes. Keep everything else intact.
* **Task**: Decode the payload using `hex2str` or `Buffer.from` and log the decoded value.

### Required Modification

Inside `handle_advance`, the payload is available as:

```js
const payload = data["payload"];
```

Use the `hex2str` function to decode it, then log the result using `console.log`.

### Input

The input sent to your function will be:

```js
"Happy Holidays, Everyone!"
```

Internally, the application will receive this value as a hex-encoded string. After decoding, the logged output will be the original message.
