# Step 11: Treasure from Another World!

Now, what about depositing assets inside your dApp, assets that are not native to it?

The concept of a wallet remains the same, but the implementation here is a little different.

Remember at the start of your dApp implementation where it was mentioned that the `handle_advance` function was triggered by the Input Box smart contract hosted on the underlying chain?

It can also be triggered by another smart contract (or others): the portals! We have Ether, ERC20, ERC721, and ERC1155 portal contracts. Whenever one of these receives a deposit, it triggers an input on your dApp with information about who is depositing and the amount deposited.

Let's implement this. The most important thing to understand is that this special trigger of the `handle_advance` function comes with a different `msg_sender`. This sender is the address of the portals contract.

For the sake of this example, let's say the address of the **Ether Portal Contract** is `0xFfdbe43d4c855BF7e0f105c400A50857f53AB044`. So whenever we receive an input from this address, we will know it is a deposit.

## User Instructions

- **Code Editing Guidelines**: Focus on the `deposit` function, which will manage the token deposits. Adjust the wallet balance based on inputs.
- **Task**: Review the `handle_advance` function to understand how routing is implemented for a deposit that comes from a portals contract.

### The `deposit` Function

- Implement the rest of the function to adjust the wallet balance:
```javascript
if (!wallet[sender]) {
  wallet[sender] = { ether: BigInt(0) };
}

wallet[sender].ether += value;
```

Remember that the Ether value uses the BigInt type, and it cannot be stringified through `JSON.stringify`, so converting it to a string is necessary.

## Input

This input is a payable deposit to the Ether portal smart contract.
