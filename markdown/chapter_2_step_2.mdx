# Chapter 11: Treasure from another world!

Now, what about depositing assets inside you dApp, assets that are not native to it?

The concept of wallet remains the same, but the implementation here is a little different.

Remember that in the start of you dApp implementation where it was mentioned that the `handle_advance` was triggered by the input box smart contract hosted on the underlaying chain?

It can also be triggered by another smart contract (or others). The portals! We have Ether, ERC20, ERC721 and ERC1155 portals contracts. Whenever one of those receive a deposit it triggers an input on your dApp with the information of who is depositing it and the amount deposited!

Let's implement this. The most important thing is to understand that this special trigger of the `handle_advance` comes with a different msg_sender. This sender is the address of the portals contract.

For the sake of this example let's say the address of the **Ethers Portal Contract** is `0xFfdbe43d4c855BF7e0f105c400A50857f53AB044` So whenever we receive an input from this address we will know it is a deposit

## User Instructions

- **Code Editing Guidelines**: Focus on the `deposit` function that will manage the token deposits. Change the balance of the wallet based on inputs.
- **Task**: Check the `handle_advance` function to see how the routing is implemented for a deposit that comes from a portals contract.

### The `sellAssets` Function

- Implement the rest of the function to change wallet balance
```javascript
if (!wallet[sender]) {
  wallet[sender] = { ether: BigInt(0) }
}

wallet[sender].ether += value
```

## Input

This input is a payable deposit to the ethers portal smart contract.
